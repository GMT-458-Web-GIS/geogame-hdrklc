# Geo-Guess Game

## Design of the Geo-Game 

### Requirements
1. **Map Display**: A world map where a random marker is placed.
2. **User Interaction**: User guesses the country or ocean, submits the guess.
3. **Feedback**: Shows correct/incorrect feedback and displays information about the location.
4. **Scoring System**: Points awarded based on correct guesses and response time.
5. **Restart Option**: Allows restarting the game.

### Frontend Layout
- **Header**: Game title.
- **Map Area**: Displays the world map with a random marker.
- **Score Panel**: Displays the player‚Äôs current score.
- **Guess Input**: Field to enter guesses.
- **Feedback Popup**: Shows if the guess was correct or incorrect.
- **Info Popup**: Provides additional information about the location.
- **Restart Button**: Resets the game.

### JavaScript Library Used
- **OpenLayers**: For rendering and interacting with the map.

# GeoGuessr Game: Drag and Drop to Find the Country üåç

GeoGuessr Game is a fun and educational game where you try to locate the correct country on the map by dragging and dropping a marker. Test your geographical knowledge while having a great time!

---

## üìñ How to Play?

### 1. Learn the Target Country
The name of the target country is displayed in the **"Current Target"** section of the scoreboard. Your goal is to locate this country.

### 2. Drag the Marker
Drag the red marker, which is located in the center of the map, using your mouse and move it to the borders of the target country.

### 3. Submit Your Guess
After placing the marker on the target country, click the **"Submit"** button to make your guess.

### 4. See the Result
- **Correct Guess**: A "Correct!" notification will appear in a green box, and you will earn 10 points.
- **Wrong Guess**: A "Wrong!" notification will appear in a red box with the correct country name. The game will reset.

### 5. Collect Your Score
- Earn **10 points** for each correct guess.
- If you make a wrong guess, your score will reset to zero.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For page layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and map controls.
- **OpenLayers**: For map functionality and draggable marker.

---

## üéÆ Have Fun!

## Event Handlers

### 1. Submit Button Click Event
- **Purpose**: Triggers when the **Submit** button is clicked.
- **Functionality**: Checks if the draggable marker is correctly placed:
  - Displays success or error notifications.
  - Updates the score and generates a new target for correct guesses.
  - Resets the game for incorrect guesses.

---

### 2. Draggable Marker Modification Event
- **Purpose**: Allows the user to move the marker on the map.
- **Functionality**: Dynamically updates the marker's position as the user drags it.

---

### 3. Game Initialization (Window Load Event)
- **Purpose**: Sets up the game when the page loads.
- **Functionality**: Initializes the map, sets a target country, and places a draggable marker.

## Use of Closures

Closures were utilized in the project to maintain access to variables and functions across different scopes. For example:

- The `checkMarkerPosition` function accesses the `targetCountry` variable defined in the parent scope to compare the draggable marker's position with the target country.
- The closure ensures that the game logic remains modular, allowing functions like `generateTargetCountry` and `resetMarker` to interact seamlessly without global variables.

This approach helped improve code readability and maintainability by keeping the logic encapsulated.

## Interaction with the DOM

The project interacts with the DOM to provide dynamic updates and enhance user experience:

- **Updating Elements**: The scoreboard (`#score-value`) and the target country (`#country-name`) are updated dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Event Listeners**: Buttons like **Submit** are connected to event handlers for user interaction.
- **Pop-Up Notifications**: Notifications are created and styled dynamically as DOM elements to display feedback (e.g., "Correct!" or "Wrong!").
- **Marker Interaction**: The draggable marker's position is continuously monitored and linked to user actions on the map.

These interactions ensure the game responds in real-time to user input.


Enjoy the game and improve your geographical knowledge while competing for the highest score! üéÆ üåç
